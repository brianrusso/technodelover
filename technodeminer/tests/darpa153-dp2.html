    <p>DARPA’s mission is to prevent technological surprise for the United States and to create technological surprise for its adversaries.  The DARPA SBIR Program is designed to provide small, high-tech businesses and academic institutions the opportunity to propose radical, innovative, high-risk approaches to address existing and emerging national security threats; thereby supporting DARPA’s overall strategy to bridge the gap between fundamental discoveries and the provision of new military capabilities.</p>
    <p>The responsibility for implementing DARPA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program rests with the Small Business Programs Office.</p>

    <a class="toc-title" name="1.2"><p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p></a>
    <p>Use of the DARPA SBIR/STTR Information Portal (SSIP) is MANDATORY.  The registered Corporate Official (CO) <strong>MUST</strong> authenticate into the SSIP (via the DARPA Extranet) to retrieve the source selection decision notice, to request debriefings, and to upload reports (awarded contracts only).  DARPA SBPO will automatically create an extranet account for new users and send the SSIP URL, authentication credentials, and login instructions AFTER the 15.3 source selection period has closed.  DARPA extranet accounts will ONLY be created for the individual named as the CO on the Proposal Cover Sheet.  Offerors may not request accounts for additional users at this time.</p>
    <p>DARPA contractors who are not eligible to receive a Common Access Card (CAC) are required to obtain a digital certificate from an approved External Certification Authority (ECA) vendor.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the SBC has or will register for multiple ECAs, one of the registered ECA e-mail addresses MUST match the CO e-mail address (listed on the Proposal Cover Sheet).</li>
        <li>Additional information will be sent to small business concerns (SBCs) selected for contract award</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: The Corporate Official (CO) e-mail address (from the Proposal Cover Sheet) will be used to create a DARPA Extranet account.  The same e-mail MUST also be used for ECA registration.  Updates to Corporate Official e-mail after proposal submission may cause significant delays to communication retrieval and contract negotiation (if selected).

    <p>Your topic may have been identified by the program manager as research involving Human and/or Animal Use.  In accordance with DoD policy, human and/or animal subjects in research conducted or supported by DARPA shall be protected.  Although these protocols were most likely not needed to carry out the Phase I, significant lead time is required to prepare the documentation and obtain approval in order to avoid delay of the DP2 award.  Please visit <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147486611" target="_blank">http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147486611</a> to review the Human Use PowerPoint presentation to understand what is required to comply with human protocols and <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147486040" target="_blank">http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2147486040</a> to review the Animal Use PowerPoint presentation to understand what is required to comply with animal protocols.  Offerors proposing research involving human and/or animal use are encouraged to separate these tasks in the Technical Volume and Cost Volume in order to avoid potential delay of contract award.</p>
    <ul class="lower-alpha">
        <li><strong>Human Use</strong>: All research involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human data, selected for funding must comply with the federal regulations for human subject protection.  Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, <i>Protection of Human Subjects</i></li>
        <li>DoD Directive 3216.02, <i>Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research</i> (<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf</a>).
</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp" target="_blank">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp</a>).  All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must also have a valid Assurance.  In addition, personnel involved in human subjects research must provide documentation of completing appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.</li>
            <li>For all proposed research that will involve human subjects <u>in the first year or phase of the project</u>, the institution must provide evidence of or a plan for review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) upon final proposal submission to DARPA.  The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution’s Assurance.  The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis.  Consult the designated IRB for guidance on writing the protocol.  The informed consent document must comply with federal regulations (32 CFR 219.116).  A valid Assurance along with evidence of appropriate training for all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.</li>
            <li>In addition to a local IRB approval, a headquarters-level human subjects regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD.  The Army, Navy or Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about their component’s headquarters-level review process. Note that confirmation of a current Assurance and appropriate human subjects protection training <u>is required</u> before headquarters-level approval can be issued.</li>
            <li>The amount of time required to complete the IRB review/approval process may vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants.  Ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process.  The IRB approval process can last between one to three months, followed by a DoD review that could last between three to six months.  No DoD/DARPA funding can be used towards human subject research until ALL approvals are granted.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Animal Use:</strong>  Any Recipient performing research, experimentation, or testing involving the use of animals shall comply with the rules on animal acquisition, transport, care, handling and use in: (i) 9 CFR parts 1-4, Department of Agriculture rules that implement the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 2131-2159); (ii) the guidelines described in National Institutes of Health Publication No. 86-23, "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"; (iii) DoD Directive 3216.01, “Use of Laboratory Animals in DoD Program.”</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For submissions containing animal use, proposals should briefly describe plans for Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) review and approval. Animal studies in the program will be expected to comply with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, available at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm" target="_blank">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm</a>.</li>
            <li>All Recipients must receive approval by a DoD certified veterinarian, in addition to an IACUC approval.  No animal studies may be conducted using DoD/DARPA funding until the USAMRMC Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) or other appropriate DoD veterinary office(s) grant approval.  As a part of this secondary review process, the Recipient will be required to complete and submit an ACURO Animal Use Appendix, which may be found at <a href="https://mrmc-www.army.mil/index.cfm?pageid=Research_Protections.acuro&rn=1" target="_blank">https://mrmc-www.army.mil/index.cfm?pageid=Research_Protections.acuro&rn=1</a>.</li>

    <p class="indent"><strong>Phase II Option</strong></p>
    <p class="indent">DARPA has implemented the use of a Phase II Option that may be exercised at the DARPA Program Manager's discretion to continue funding Phase II activities that will further mature the technology for insertion into a larger DARPA Program, DoD Acquisition Program, other Federal agency, or commercialization into the private sector. The statement of work for the Phase II Option MUST be included with the Phase II Technical Volume and should describe Phase II activities, over a 12 month period, that may lead to the successful demonstration of a product or technology.  The statement of work for the option counts toward the 40-page limit for the Phase II Technical Volume. If selected, the government may elect not to include the option in the negotiated contract.</p>

<div class="row">
    <a class="toc-title" name="7.4"><p><strong>7.4 Commercialization Strategy</strong></p></a>
    <p>DARPA is equally interested in dual use commercialization of SBIR project results to the U.S. military, the private sector market, or both, and expects explicit discussion of key activities to achieve this result in the commercialization strategy part of the proposal. The discussion should include identification of the problem, need, or requirement relevant to a Department of Defense application and/or a private sector application that the SBIR project results would address; a description of how wide-spread and significant the problem, need, or requirement is; and identification of the potential DoD end-users, Federal customers, and/or private sector customers who would likely use the technology.</p>
    <p>Technology commercialization and transition from Research and Development activities to fielded systems within the DoD is challenging. Include transition and commercialization activities conducted during Phase I, and how the preliminary transition path or paths may evolve during the Phase II project.  That plan should include the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) achieved at the end of the Phase I.  The plan should include anticipated business model and potential private sector and federal partners the company has identified to support transition and commercialization activities.  In addition, key proposed milestones anticipated during Phase II such as: prototype development, laboratory and systems testing, integration, testing in operational environment, and demonstrations.</p>
    <p>At a minimum, your commercialization strategy must address the following five questions:</p>
    <ul class="numeric">
        <li>What is the first product that this technology will go into?</li>
        <li>Who will be the customers, and what is the estimated market size?</li>
        <li>How much money will be needed to bring the technology to market, and how will that money be raised?</li>
        <li>Does the company contain marketing expertise and, if not, how will that expertise be brought into the company?</li>
        <li>Who are the offeror’s competitors, and what is the price and/or quality advantage over those competitors?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The commercialization strategy must also include a schedule showing the anticipated quantitative commercialization results from the Phase II project at one year after the start of Phase II, at the completion of Phase II, and after the completion of Phase II (i.e., amount of additional investment, sales revenue, etc.).  After Phase II award, the company is required to report actual sales and investment data in its Company Commercialization Report (see Section 7.5.e) at least annually.</p>
    <p>In addition, each Phase II proposal must contain a five-page commercialization strategy as part of the Technical Volume, addressing the following questions:</p>
    <ul class="numeric">
        <li>Product Description/System Application – Identify the Commercial product(s) and/or DoD system(s) or system(s) under development or potential new systems that this technology will be/or has the potential to be integrated into.</li>
        <li>Advocacy Letters** – Feedback received from potential Commercial and/or DoD customers and other end-users regarding their interest in the technology to support their capability gaps.</li>
        <li>Letters of Intent/Commitment** – Relationships established, feedback received, support and commitment for the technology with one or more of the following: Commercial customer, DoD PM/PEO, a Defense Prime, or vendor/supplier to the Primes and/or other vendors/suppliers identified as having a potential role in the integration of the technology into fielded systems/products or those under development.</li>
        <li>Business Models/Procurement Mechanisms/Vehicles – Business models, procurement mechanisms, vehicles and, as relevant, commercial channels, and/or licensing/teaming agreements you plan to employ to sell into your targeted markets.</li>
        <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>What is the business model you plan to adopt to generate revenue from your innovation?</li>
            <li>Describe the procurement mechanisms, vehicles and channels you plan to employ to reach the targeted markets/customers.</li>
            <li>If you plan to pursue a licensing model, what is your plan to identify potential licensees? </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Market/Customer Sets/Value Proposition – Describe the market and customer sets you propose to target, their size, and their key reasons they would consider procuring the technology.</li>
        <li>What is the current size of the broad market you plan to enter and the “niche” market opportunity you are addressing?</li>
        <li>What are the growth trends for the market and the key trends in the industry that you are planning to target?</li>
        <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>What features of your technology will allow you to provide a compelling value proposition?</li>
            <li>Have you validated the significance of these features and if not, how do you plan to validate?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Competition Assessment – Describe the competition in these markets/customer sets and your anticipated advantage (e.g., function, performance, price, quality, etc.)</li>
        <li>Funding Requirements – List your targeted funding sources (e.g., federal, state and local, private (internal, loan, angel, venture capital, etc.) and your proposed plan and schedule to secure this funding. Provide anticipated funding requirements both during and after Phase II required to:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>mature the technology</li>
            <li>as required, mature the manufacturing processes</li>
            <li>test and evaluate the technology</li>
            <li>receive required certifications</li>
            <li>secure patents, or other protections of intellectual property</li>
            <li>manufacture the technology to bring the technology to market for use in operational environments</li>
            <li>market/sell technology to targeted customers</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sales Projections – Provide a schedule that outlines your anticipated sales projections and indicate when you anticipate breaking even.</li>
        <li>Expertise/Qualifications of Team/Company Readiness - Describe the expertise and qualifications of your management, marketing/business development and technical team that will support the transition of the technology from the prototype to the commercial market and into operational environments. Has this team previously taken similar products/services to market? If the present team does not have this needed expertise, how do you intend to obtain it?  What is the financial history and health of your company (e.g., availability of cash, profitability, revenue growth, etc.)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>**Please note: In accordance with section 3-209 of DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, letters from government personnel will NOT be considered during the evaluation process.</p>

                <li><strong>Subcontractors/Consultants</strong>. Involvement of a university or other subcontractors or consultants in the project may be appropriate. If such involvement is intended, it should be described in detail and identified in the Cost Volume. A minimum of one-half of the research and/or analytical work in Phase II, as measured by direct and indirect costs, must be carried out by the offeror, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. No portion of an SBIR award may be subcontracted back to any Federal government agency, including Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). SBA may issue a case-by-case waiver to this provision after review of the DoD component's written justification that includes the following information: (a) an explanation of why the SBIR research project requires the use of the Federal facility or personnel, including data that verifies the absence of non-federal facilities or personnel capable of supporting the research effort; (b) why the Agency will not and cannot fund the use of the Federal facility or personnel for the SBIR project with non-SBIR money; and (c) the concurrence of the small business concern's chief business official to use the Federal facility or personnel. Award is contingent on the sponsoring agency obtaining a waiver.</li>
                <li><strong>Prior, Current or Pending Support of Similar Proposals or Awards</strong>. Warning -- While it is permissible, with proposal notification, to submit identical proposals or proposals containing a significant amount of essentially equivalent work for consideration under numerous federal program solicitations, it is unlawful to enter into contracts or grants requiring essentially equivalent effort. If there is any question concerning this, it must be disclosed to the soliciting agency or agencies before award.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cost Volume (Volume 3)</li>
            <p>Offerors are REQUIRED to use the online Cost Volume (<a href="https://sbir.defensebusiness.org/" target="_blank">https://sbir.defensebusiness.org/</a>) for the Phase II and Phase II Option costs.  Additional details and explanations regarding the Cost Volume may be uploaded as an appendix to the Technical Volume. The Cost Volume (and supporting documentation) DOES NOT count toward the 40-page limit of the Technical Volume.  Phase II awards and options are subject to the availability of funds.</p>
            <p>The Phase II Cost Volume must not exceed the maximum dollar amount of $1,000,000 (24 months) or $1,010,000 if discretionary technical assistance services are proposed. Offerors proposing a Phase II Option must also submit a Phase II Option Cost Volume, not to exceed $500,000 (12 months).</p>
            <p>Some items in the Cost Breakdown Guidance may not apply to the proposed project. If such is the case, there is no need to provide information on each and every item. What matters is that enough information be provided to allow DARPA to understand how the offeror plans to use the requested funds if the contract is awarded.</p>
            <ul class="numeric">
                <li>List all key personnel by name as well as by number of hours dedicated to the project as direct labor.</li>
                <li>1.	Special tooling and test equipment and material cost may be included. The inclusion of equipment and material will be carefully reviewed relative to need and appropriateness for the work proposed. The purchase of special tooling and test equipment must, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, be advantageous to the Government and should be related directly to the specific topic. These may include such items as innovative instrumentation and/or automatic test equipment. Title to property furnished by the Government or acquired with Government funds will be vested with the DoD Component; unless it is determined that transfer of title to the contractor would be more cost effective than recovery of the equipment by the DoD Component.</li>
                <li>Cost for travel funds must be justified and related to the needs of the project.</li>
                <li>Cost sharing is permitted for proposals under this solicitation; however, cost sharing is not required nor will it be an evaluation factor in the consideration of a DP2 proposal.</li>
                <li>The costs for the base and option (if proposed) are clearly separate and identified in the cost volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If selected for award, the offeror should be prepared to submit further documentation to the DoD Contracting Officer to substantiate costs (e.g., a brief explanation of cost estimates for equipment, materials, and consultants or subcontractors). For more information about the Cost Volume and accounting standards, see the DCAA publication called "Information for Contractors" available at <a href="http://www.dcaa.mil/audit_process_overview.html" target="_blank">http://www.dcaa.mil/audit_process_overview.html</a>.</p>
            <li>Company Commercialization Report (CCR) (Volume 4)</li>
            <p>All offerors are required to prepare a CCR through the DoD SBIR/STTR Submission Web Site (<a href="https://sbir.defensebusiness.org/" target="_blank">https://sbir.defensebusiness.org/</a>).  List in the CCR, the quantitative commercialization results of the offeror’s prior Phase II projects, including the items such as sales revenue, additional investment, as well as other information relative to the offeror’s commercialization track record. All prior Phase II projects must be reported, regardless of whether the project has any commercialization to date. The results are compared to the historical averages for the DoD SBIR or STTR Programs to calculate a Commercialization Achievement Index (CAI) value. Only offerors with four or more completed Phase II projects will receive a CAI score; otherwise the CAI is N/A. Offerors with a CAI at the 20th percentile or below may receive no more than half of the evaluation points available for commercial potential criteria.  A score of N/A will not affect the offerors ability to be selected for an award.</p>
            <p>Offerors may also include at the end of the Report additional, explanatory material (no more than five pages) relating to the offeror’s record of commercializing its prior SBIR or STTR projects, such as: commercialization successes (in government and/or private sector markets) that are not fully captured in the quantitative results (e.g. commercialization resulting from the offeror's prior Phase I projects); any mitigating factors that could account for low commercialization; and recent changes in the offeror's organization or personnel designed to increase the offeror's commercialization success. The CCR and additional explanatory material (if any) will not be counted toward the page limit for DP2 proposals.</p>

Relevant supporting data such as journal articles, literature, including Government publications, etc., should be contained or referenced in the proposal and will count toward the page limit.  Where technical evaluations are essentially equal in merit, cost to the Government will be considered in determining the successful offeror.</p>
    <p>The offeror's attention is directed to the fact that non-Government advisors to the Government may review and provide support in proposal evaluations during source selection.  Non-government advisors may have access to the offeror's proposals, may be utilized to review proposals, and may provide comments and recommendations to the Government's decision makers.  These advisors will not establish final assessments of risk and will not rate or rank offeror's proposals.  They are also expressly prohibited from competing for DARPA SBIR or STTR awards in the SBIR/STTR topics they review and/or provide comments on to the Government.  All advisors are required to comply with procurement integrity laws and are required to sign Non-Disclosure Agreement and Rules of Conduct/Conflict of Interest statements.

    <p>TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): &nbsp; Biomedical, Sensors</p>	
	
	<p>OBJECTIVE: &nbsp; Develop and demonstrate clinically-viable bio-interface technologies that have mechanical properties similar to tissue, yet can interface with conventional benchtop and/or implantable electronics to form complete systems for biological sensing and modulation. Areas of interest include implantable interface technologies for neural and other biological tissue, as well as wearable biosensors and interfaces.</p>
	
	<p>DESCRIPTION: &nbsp; There is a critical need for DoD capabilities that would provide breakthrough medical treatments for wounded warriors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, immune system dysfunction and other DoD-relevant health issues. Regulation of neural and other biological functions via interface technologies has become increasingly enticing as a means of clinical treatment [1]. For instance, over the past several decades we have seen the emergence of neural recording and stimulation to restore sensorimotor capability and vagal nerve stimulation technologies for the treatment of epilepsy and depression. While these treatments have achieved moderate success, existing clinically approved technologies offer limited stability and precision, which significantly hinders their clinical translation. Despite recent noteworthy advancements in pre-clinical electrode technologies, existing devices suffer from reliability problems, often associated with tissue damage and/or mechanical failure of the device [2].</p>
	<p>Even state-of-the-art interface technologies exert high mechanical strain on surrounding tissues, leading to scarring, persistent bleeding and neuronal damage. Tissue in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has Young’s Modulus of approximately 600 kPa. Traditional electrodes are manufactured using either fine metal wires, such as platinum (168 GPa), or microfabricated from silicon (180 GPa). This six order of magnitude difference in stiffness leads to a number of issues—including tissue damage, surgical attachment and relative motion—which reduce the clinical viability of these technologies. By developing bio-interfaces with kPa-scale stiffness, it would be possible to attach neuromodulation devices to the PNS without incurring these problems. Proposed implantable neural interface devices should be able to penetrate the tough epineurium of a specified nerve (e.g. vagus, ulnar), enter multiple fascicles and accommodate the range of motion that the nerve typically encounters. Wearable technologies should similarly match the mechanical properties of skin and tissue to provide robust, biocompatible solutions for biological interfacing.</p>
	<p>This topic seeks to advance the clinical readiness of bio-interface technologies by decreasing the biomechanical mismatch between manufactured devices and biological tissue. The most established approaches in this space use polymeric substrates with embedded conductors [3]. There have been recent advances in materials that may push the Young’s Modulus down even further, such as shape memory polymers that soften when inserted into tissue [4]. While these advances are important, all still use substrate materials that have a modulus greater than 10 MPa. Some early demonstrations of biologic materials such as collagen [5] have yielded crude but functional devices with kPa-scale stiffness properties. Dissolvable carrier substrates [6] have also shown promising results, but depend heavily upon the dissolution rate of the sacrificial material and leave behind tiny but stiff electrodes.</p>
	<p>Despite these advances in materials science and device fabrication, there has been little progress towards demonstration of functional devices, much less mechanical testing with ex vivo nerve tissue or in vivo electrophysiological validation. Without this validation, promising new technologies will not be adopted by the neural interface community or medical device manufacturers.</p>
	
	<p>PHASE I: &nbsp; Proposals to this topic should aim to develop and/or demonstrate mechanically compliant yet reliable biological interface devices that are wearable or implantable, enabling direct monitoring or modulation of biological signals in peripheral nerves and organs. Implantable PNS-specific devices should demonstrate an ability to penetrate the epineurium and perineurium of a nerve to insert kPa-scale electrodes into individual fascicles, and to do so at a scale and precision relevant to neuromodulation therapies. These devices should include interconnects to mate with standard benchtop or implantable electrophysiology equipment. Wearable devices should provide reliable measurement of biological signals that are relevant to quantifying health physiology.</p>
	
	<p>Phase I deliverables include:<br>
	Proof of concept demonstrating the feasibility of manufacturing and implementing novel soft bio-interface devices. Feasibility may be demonstrated through a variety of models, including tissue phantoms, in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo studies. The final report must include a quantitative analysis of interface properties and mechanical characteristics. The final report should also contain detailed plans for Phase II.</p>
	
	<p>PHASE II: &nbsp; Work in this SBIR topic should focus upon creating fully functioning interface devices suitable for chronic implantation in vivo. Performers should develop manufacturing and testing procedures to produce and verify the flexible bio-interface assembly. Devices should comprise a set of interconnects, flexible tethering leads and a compliant substrate containing a multitude of interface sites for stimulating and/or sensing neural activity (at fascicular resolution or better) or measuring biomolecules in vivo. The interface assemblies must be safe, effective and chronically stable for long-term use in animals or humans.</p>
	
	<p>Phase II deliverables include:<br>
	Demonstrate the reliability and scalability of the manufacturing approach. Proposals should include plans to develop and demonstrate individual compliant devices using batch manufacturing process flows capable of producing hundreds of identical devices. Studies should characterize the morphological and physiological properties of relevant tissue to develop advanced finite element models and validate these against ex vivo experiments with the soft interface technology. Phase II efforts must also demonstrate the lifetime of the devices through Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), including mechanical, soak and electrical testing. Finally, the devices must be tested chronically in animal models to validate sensing and modulation capability, as well as cross-talk, impedance and other relevant properties. Tissue samples must undergo histological examination to demonstrate the extent of damage incurred during application or surgical insertion as well as after chronic use.</p>
	
	<p>Direct to Phase II: Existing technologies that target peripheral nerves and have demonstrated capabilities are eligible for Direct to Phase II applications.</p>
	
	<p>PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: &nbsp; Highly effective clinical therapies for treating disease and mental health through biocompatible neuromodulation devices.</p>
	
	<p>Highly effective treatments for PTSD, anxiety, immune function, and other DoD-relevant health issues through biocompatible neuromodulation devices.</p>

	<p>OBJECTIVE: &nbsp; Develop high-sample rate, low power, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for elemental digital phased array antennas. By the end of Phase II of the program, the ADCs should have a demonstrated effective number of bits (ENOB) &gt; 6 bits, conversion rate of &gt; 40 Giga samples per second (GS/s), analog bandwidth &gt;20 GHz and power consumption &lt; 500 mW</p>
	
	<p>DESCRIPTION: &nbsp; The ability to quickly and efficiently convert radio frequency (RF) signals to the digital domain where the underlying information can be processed using digital signal processing is a critical aspect of many DoD electronics systems. A specific example are phased array antenna systems, where high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) enable the RF frequency band selection and RF beam steering to be performed using flexible and adaptive digital signal processing.</p>
	<p>Recently, great advances have been made in high sample rate (>10 GS/s), yet energy efficient ADCs [1-3], dramatically improving the well-known Walden figure-of-merit (FOM). Yet, improvements in dynamic range, analog bandwidth and especially power consumption are needed for these converters.</p>
	<p>To meet the needs of the DoD, this solicitation seeks high-sample rate ADCs that can meet the specifications of an ENOB greater than 6 bits, conversion rate faster than 40 GS/s, analog bandwidth greater than 20 GHz and power consumption less than 500 mW by the end of Phase II of the program. Designs may use digitally-assisted or other methods to improve performance. Especially of interest are ADC implementations that have beneficial physics based scaling in advanced CMOS technology nodes of 32 nm and below.</p>
	
	<p>PHASE I: &nbsp; Develop, analyze and sufficiently simulate an ADC architecture with a predicted performance of:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Power &lt; 500 mW</li>
    <li>ENOB &gt; 6b</li>
    <li>Data Rate &gt; 40 GS/s</li>
    <li>Analog Bandwidth &gt; 20 GHz</li>
    <li>FOM &lt; 200 fJ/conversion-step</li>
  </ol>
</p>

	<p>Required Phase I deliverables will include:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>A report detailing the ADC architecture, design and expected performance.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
	
	<p>PHASE II: &nbsp; Use Phase I analysis to design, build, and successfully demonstrate the operation of a prototype ADC for Government evaluation with the following specifications:<br>
  <ol>

	<p>PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: &nbsp; In the emerging 5G standard for wireless handsets, phased arrays are expected to supply the spatial filtering needed to massively increase the number of handsets supported by a single base station. Digital phased arrays would further add to the flexibility and number of simultaneous users (handsets) but further increases in ADC sample rate and bandwidth are required for digital phased arrays to emerge at 5G.</p>
	
	<p>Much like the Phase III commercial communications application, high-sample rate ADCs for DoD/Military applications are of great importance. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radio frequency systems are an effective method for in-theatre communications. These ADCs are a crucial component to breaking through the limitations of current MIMO systems to create MIMO systems supporting a greatly increased number of carriers and thus communications bandwidth.</p>
    <p>In order to reach the goals of future communications systems, Phase III ADC metrics are as follows:<br>

    <p>TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): &nbsp; Air Platform, Sensors</p>
    <p>OBJECTIVE: &nbsp; Demonstrate a conformal, thin, broadband and rapid optical beam steering device without gimbals.</p>
    <p>DESCRIPTION: &nbsp; There is a critical DoD need for a new class of broadband, random access electro-optic sensors on lightweight, airborne platforms. A conformal, thin, broadband and rapid steering beam steering device would overcome the usual, disadvantages of traditional optical systems and electro-optical devices beam steering devices, which use heavy and power-hungry gimbals and optical components making large mechanical motions. Non mechanical optical beam steering devices have been demonstrated. Most use electrically- controlled optical diffraction to steer the optical beam. These devices operate over a narrow wavelength band, since the diffraction induced steering angle depends sensitively on the wavelength of light. These narrowband devices are not suitable for broadband optical applications.</p>
    <p>Most passive electro-optic (EO) systems are broadband. Also there are laser systems, such as femto-second pulsed lasers and supercontinium lasers that are broadband and will allow broadband light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems. Providing broadband beam steering for lidar and passive EO systems could enable new LIDAR capabilities using these super continuum lasers, and new passive EO systems capability.</p>
    <p>As a baseline this effort will require operation in either the near IR wavelength region or the mid IR wavelength region. The proposed effort should discuss extending this capability to the visible and to either the NIR region or MWIR region, which ever band is not covered by the baseline approach.</p>
    <p>Threshold performance objectives are a 10 cm diameter aperture, a 60 degree field of steering in both angular dimensions, > 75% optical transmission efficiency , broadband operation over at least 10 percent bandwidth, beam quality no worse than 3 times diffraction limit, and &lt; 1 msec beam steering time. It is desire able to exceed these goals if possible. It is desirable to keep physical size small, with the beam steerer no deeper than the diameter of the clear aperture beam steering device. A key aspect of the approach is that the beam steering concept must be compatible with conformal windows on aircraft (i.e. windows that conform to the airframe surface). Beam steering approaches should be capable of operating bi-directionally, that is, as optical transmitters and receivers.</p>
    <p>PHASE I: &nbsp; Determine feasibility of possible EO beam steering approaches and evaluate their performance. The Phase I effort should result in (1) detailed physical optics simulation of light propagation through the component(s), (2) assessment of the beam steering dynamic behavior and electrical properties, and (3) preliminary evaluation of the expected size, weight, and power consumption of a prototype implementation.</p>
    <p>PHASE II: &nbsp; Demonstrate the Phase I concept via laboratory brassboard experiments, and develop a preliminary design of a device for field experiments. In Phase II, a Phase I concept will be reduced to practice and performance validated in a laboratory setting. The experiments conducted should result in empirical and/or analytic knowledge that will be used in the preliminary prototype design effort. The laboratory brassboard may not directly meet the desired threshold objectives, but should at a minimum provide characterization data and demonstrate by analysis that the performance objectives can be met. The preliminary design should focus on a demonstration system which could be utilized in a field experiment and would directly meet the performance objectives. Phase II deliverables include: (1) laboratory brassboard design, (2) report of brassboard experiment results, (3) preliminary design package for field test device.</p>
    <p>PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: &nbsp; A Phase III system could be applied to a number of commercial applications, including: 1) LIDAR measurements of wind velocities, aerosol characterization, and terrain mapping, 2) compact surveillance systems in security applications. A commercially focused Phase III effort would choose a viable commercial use and build a prototype system optimized for that application.</p>
    <p>The DoD currently uses a large number of broadband EO systems, and active EO systems (e.g. LIDAR) are increasingly of interest as well. The use of optical systems such as these is limited by the need for a turret to house the beam director. This protrusion causes aerodynamic drag that limits range and speed of the platform. Additionally, the wake turbulence can limit the useful speed and field­of­regard regime of the sensor systems. A Phase III effort would focus on increasing the TRL level of the technology to a point that is compatible with an airborne demonstration on a relevant military air platform. The effort would include any necessary component technology development, but primarily be a detailed design, integration and test phase. Phase III would include a final test and evaluation of the beam steerer with both an active EO system and a broadband passive EO sensor.</p>
