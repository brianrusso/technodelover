description_old_actual = u"""Single photon sensitive detectors have many applications including active and passive\
 imaging, traditional and upcoming quantum optical communications, and quantum information processing. For quantum\
 key distribution in fibers, for instance, the noise properties of the detectors limit the distance over which one\
 can establish a secure key. Similarly, for 3D imaging via LADAR, longitudinal resolution is limited by the detector\
 jitter while the detector sensitivity dictates the trade-off between illumination power and maximum range.\
 Therefore, a high-bandwidth, high-sensitivity, compact and readily available photon-counting detector is a key\
 technology for many future scientific developments and improved DoD application capabilities. Technologies for\
 detecting single photons in the telecom band include semiconductor devices such as Geiger-mode InGaAs avalanche\
 photodiodes (APDs) and superconducting devices like the transition edge sensor (TES). The InGaAs APDs can be operated\
 at temperatures accessible via thermoelectric cooling, making them ideal for applications requiring compact\
 photon-counting solutions. InGaAs APDs, however, are typically plagued by after-pulsing effects, making them\
 ill-suited for applications requiring high duty-cycle and high-rate detection [1]. Extremely high efficiency\
 and low dark counts can be achieved with superconducting TES detectors, but the rates are limited to less than 10\
 MHz and the systems must be operated in the 100 mK regime requiring an extensive cooling overhead [2]. New results\
 in superconducting nanowire devices [3] have shown that high detection rates, low dark-count rates (DCRs), and high\
 efficiency are all possible simultaneously with operating temperatures between 1 and 4 K. Despite these results,\
 further performance improvements are needed. For example, detection efficiency (DE) above 90% and bandwidth (BW)\
 approaching 1 GHz has yet to be achieved simultaneously. In addition, innovations leading to a reduction in the\
 system footprint and improved operability will provide better accessibility of such technologies to the relevant\
 scientific and engineering communities. The goal of this SBIR project is to further improve upon the current\
 state-of-the-art in nanowire single-photon\
 detector performance while advancing the supporting technologies to allow for a compact, turn-key commercial\
 system. The final system should provide multiple (>2), independent single-pixel detectors with performance\
 superior to all current commercially available options (DE>90%, BW~1GHz, DCR< 1 Hz) in a ~5U 19â„¢ rack-mount\
 package. To achieve these goals, work under this SBIR may include the following: efforts to increase\
 fabrication yields through the use of new materials or fabrication techniques, new device designs to\
 improve bandwidth and sensitivity, efforts to reduce system SWaP through compact, application-specific\
 cooling systems, electronics, and packaging. PHASE I: Develop an initial concept design and model through computer\
 simulations key elements of the proposed\
 nanowire single-photon detection system. Demonstrate detector development capability by fabricating and testing\
 system parts with performance indicative of a final system achieving the SBIR goals. Exhibit the feasibility\
 of the approach through a laboratory demonstration of the critical system components. Phase I deliverables will\
 include a design review including quantitative justification for the expected system performance and a report\
 presenting the plans for Phase II. PHASE II: Construct and demonstrate the operation of a prototype system\
 validating the performance metrics outlined\
 in Phase I. The final system should be near turn-key and demonstrate all relevant performance characteristics\
 including the SWaP. The Transition Readiness Level to be reached is 5: Component and/or bread-board validation\
 in relevant environment. PHASE III: The detectors developed under this SBIR will have applications for the DoD which\
 include secure\
 communications and active stand-off imaging systems. The improved availability and SWaP will allow the use of these\
 detectors in all relevant government labs and open the door to new fieldable systems. For example, low power,\
 portable optical communication links exceeding RF system bandwidths by 10-100x may be possible using the technology\
 developed under this SBIR [4,5]. The technology developed as a consequence of this effort will have applications which\
 span both DoD and non-DoD areas.\
 One application particularly suited to the private sector is the analysis of integrated circuits (IC).\
 Failure analysis via optical means is known to provide specific information about the operation of individual IC\
 elements. Higher speed and sensitivity of detection leads to higher throughput for such diagnostic systems.\
 Additionally, the technology developed under this SBIR may be integrated into commercially manufactured DoD\
 products such as LADAR and optical communication systems."""
