        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 70,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  ARMS data will also be used to support Headquarters Air Force/Major Command (HAF/MAJCOM) level readiness decision reports/analytics.  New development work in support of ARMS needs to be accomplished with RDT&amp;E versus O&amp;M funds. 

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. 

The FY2017 funding request was reduced by 0.387 Million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety-of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line (COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.
 
New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information, which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness, and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following:  electronic flight record, enhanced flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and interface with DRRS-S.  Additional development work on the existing ARMS, such as database flattening and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) actions, is required prior to incorporating these enhanced capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
