                    <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, Project 671017, CE IT Transformation, was completed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NexGen IT is a key USAF effort to comply with statutory and regulatory policy and guidance associated with Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) efforts. 

NexGen IT will transform Civil Engineering (CE) business processes to improve operations and support AF priorities.  The plan is to leverage industry best practices, optimize core business processes, and replace existing outdated IT capabilities with a set of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solutions and secure a service provider to deploy and maintain the system.  This COTS solution will provide a robust, enterprise-wide CE capability that will consist of an integrated set of embedded / configurable best business practices and capabilities to support the following CE missions:  Real Property Management (RPM), Work &amp; Supply Management (WSM), Project Management (PM), and Energy Management (EnM).  Capabilities are to be configured, tested, and deployed as Capability Groups.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
