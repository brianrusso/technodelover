                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding was reduced by $.086M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development as this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
