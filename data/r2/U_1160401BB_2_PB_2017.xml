        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the SOF Technology Demonstration effort include:

•  SOF Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.

•  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL funds Applied Research projects identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL applies leading edge nanotechnology, biometric and biotechnology, and chemistry which is directed towards the development of revolutionary tags, taggants, sensors, communications, and data processing.

•  Classified Sub-Project (provided under separate cover).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
