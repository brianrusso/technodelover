        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) terrain following/terrain avoidance radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF ISR platforms.  

CV-22 Development:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support. The Block 10 increment was completed in FY 2007, and the Block 20 increment started in FY 2008.  Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing.  This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Radar (Silent Knight Radar) program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling. The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the investigation, evaluation, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements.  Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD), terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures (DCM) which includes Electronic Warfare – Radio Frequency Countermeasures (EW-RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA); near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection and identification technologies; digital broadcast capability; aerial refueling; and Intelligence, Surveillance, Survivability and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF ISR platforms.

• EC-130J Upgrades provides for integration of SOF-unique implementation of the C-130J block cycle upgrade as installed on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft and development of digital broadcast capabilities. 

• Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA) provides SOF C-130 fleet with near-real-time intelligence reporting to include data fusion, threat detection, identification, and avoidance.

• EW-RFCM supports development, integration and test activities to provide EW capability against RF threats for SOF AC/MC-130J aircraft.  The DCM suite is an integrated package of existing aircraft defensive systems which provides situational awareness and threat response processing; this includes the Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) system, and future defensive systems.  RFCM program provides SOF-unique aircraft defensive capabilities required for SOF missions.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.636 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

• PSP for SOF supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP for later integration and installation onto host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H, AC-130W and AC-130U recapitalization, as well as current SOF C-130s and other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130 aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, and Armed Reconnaissance.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral.

• PSP Large Caliber Gun supports systems engineering, analysis, development, integration, and test of a large caliber gun capability enhancement to the PSP installed on the AC-130 aircraft. 

• C-130 TF Radar System supports development, integration and test of a TF/TA radar and on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability on MC-130J aircraft.  Crew systems integration efforts include modifications to aircraft controls and displays to automate TF/TA flight and reduce pilot, copilot and Combat Systems Officer workload during missions previously performed by five aircrew members on legacy C-130 tankers and penetrators. This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $4.636 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development, qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF common TF/TA LPI/LPD radar to defeat advanced passive detection threats while maintaining ability to fly safe TF.  This radar is targeted for use on all MH-47G heavy assault helicopters, MH-60M medium assault helicopters, MC-130J Commando II and CV-22B Osprey aircraft.

• EC-130J Commando Solo supports development, integration and testing of digital broadcast capabilities on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology supports development, integration, and testing of sensor miniaturization effort to place large ISR platform capability, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aerial systems (UASs) onto all SOF ISR platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• ESA:  Integrate Government/Commercial off-the-shelf communications and computing hardware and software into into carry-on kits for enhanced situational awareness systems.

• EW – RFCM:  Award up to two competitive Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts for development, integration and test of an RF Countermeasures System on AC/MC-130J aircraft.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP Large Caliber Gun:  Combination of Government Service activity and contractor development, integration and test for large caliber gun capability enhancement for the PSP installed on AC-130 aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• C-130 TF Radar System:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF common APQ-187 TF radar system on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls. Government development, Test and Evaluation, FY 2018 - FY 2020; Operational Test and Evaluation, FY 2021 with Initial Operational Capability, Q4FY2021.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Competitive EMD contract was awarded to Raytheon in FY 2007 for radar B Kit design, development, and testing.  Subsequent MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit design, integration, and test efforts awarded to Lockheed Martin (SOFSA). Follow-on platform A Kit design, integration, and test efforts will be awarded in FY 2018 - FY 2019.  MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit production and installation will be completed at the SOFSA. A follow-on Full Rate Production Firm-Fixed-Price contract following completion of operational testing.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO:  Digital broadcast capabilities are being developed through an incremental acquisition strategy to incorporate and test readily available equipment into the EC-130J aircraft.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them useable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft.  The CV-22 provides long range, high speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by existing aircraft. The V-22 Joint Program Office is developing improved capabilities in block increments supported with rapid prototyping. The funding in this project supports these block increments as well as associated flight test support.

• Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.

• CV-22 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Radar:  Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable radar to replace obsolescing and tech limited APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The CV-22 program is managed by the Navy V-22 Joint Program Office (NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275). This ensures that the CV-22 changes are incorporated into the ongoing V-22 production line with minimum impact. Funding for the baseline CV-22 Engineering Manufacturing and Development, known as Block 0, is embedded in the Navy budget. Block 20 and subsequent block upgrades are planned to follow the same acquisition strategy, with NAVAIRSYSCOM PMA-275 ensuring the integration of SOF-unique systems with the ongoing basic vehicle improvements supporting both the CV-22 and the Marine Corps MV-22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) to support training, avoid obsolescence, and maintain simulator concurrency with weapon system configurations; support mission planning and rehearsal systems enhancements required to meet Special Operations Force (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing; and support mission planning and rehearsal capabilities in current MTPS. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.

Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique modifications to replace aging/retired MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, and AC-130U Spooky airframes. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. These platforms perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions and clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. USSOCOM will then employ an incremental upgrade approach to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the Air Force-provided aircraft.

Conducts development, integration, and testing of aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, enhanced situational awareness (ESA), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  

•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade Non-Developmental Item/Commercial Off-the-Shelf (NDI/COTS) will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications. This sub-project includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, munitions for testing and enhanced aircraft self-protection. 

•  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft protection.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $2.000 million to account for the prior year execution balances.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. 

•  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aviator.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in DVE such as dirt and snow.  This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages to the maximum extent possible, the use of existing sensors on SOF aircraft.  

•  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-peculiar modifications to the common aircraft.

•  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will develop, integrate, qualify, and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system, countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.

•  MH-47G Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but not limited to the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS), Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapid emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $5.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

•  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit (GPPU): (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.  The FY 2017 funding request was reduced by $3.000 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

•  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increasing functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe/rotors development effort will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, who owns the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Triumph Electronic Control Systems under sole-source contract to Rolls Royce.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be NDI/COTS and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M SOF Modifications and Upgrades supports the systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-peculiar upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process will be conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of the DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM develops, integrates, and qualifies a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability which does not currently exist at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Naval Research Lab IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS, ANC and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole-source to Sanmina SCI Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.

•  NGFLIR utilizes the Common Sensor Payload, an existing Army program of record, as a life-cycle replacement for the Q2V2 EOSS.  This effort mainly consists of upgrading the camera from Standard Definition to High Definition utilizing existing Army contracts with the OEM.  SOF unique integration on the MH-60M DAP platforms will be accomplished through existing aircraft modification contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
