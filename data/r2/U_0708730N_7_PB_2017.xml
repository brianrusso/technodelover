                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NSRP ASE is a collaboration of U.S. shipyards working with the Navy customer to reduce the cost of building and repairing naval ships and improving shipbuilding industry productivity through advanced technology and processes. NSRP ASE is an innovative and proven approach to public/private cooperation to manage cost-shared R&amp;D based on a national consensus Strategic Investment Plan. The Plan targets potential industry-wide technology and process solutions which are vetted by industry experts and builds upon the progress
made over the previous years. The collaboration's organizational structure promotes teaming of industry, government and academia to achieve the continuous product and process improvements necessary for improved Navy ship affordability.  Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-wide initiatives with aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards. Navy PEOs (Ships, Subs and Carriers) and NAVSEA are directly involved in NSRP.  The Plan calls for matching government and industry investments over several years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Ship Production Technologies, Business Process and Information Systems, and Infrastructure and Support (Regulatory
Compliance, Technology Transfer and Workforce Development) that were competitively selected by industry subject
matter experts and Navy stakeholders during Government Fiscal Year (GFY14). The projects targeted the following priorities in Naval shipbuilding
and repair: (1)Improving Quality; (2) Reduction of Total Ownership Costs; and, (3) Increasing Energy Efficiency. It is
anticipated that projects currently in process will continue to be focused in the following areas:
- Promotion of Modular Construction
- Reduction of Re-work
- Improving Production Engineering
- Improving Specifications and Standards
- Improving Manufacturing Processes
- Improving Production Planning
- Data Exchange
- Improving Safety &amp; Health / Reducing Environmental Impacts
