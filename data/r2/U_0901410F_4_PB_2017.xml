                    <r2:ProjectNote>CON-IT initiated as a New Start in FY2015 within PE 0728060F, Acquisition and Management Support, Project 662906, Electronic Acquisition Service Environment (EASE). In FY2017 CON-IT transfers to PE 0901410F, Contracting Information Technology System, Project 643483, CON-IT, due to scope expansion beyond the EASE project and to enhance transparency, reporting, and execution activities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Contracting Information Technology System (CON-IT) provides a single contract writing system for the Air Force contracting community to support all contracting needs including base operations, logistics, contingency and weapons system contracting world-wide.  CON-IT will enable strategic sourcing and other acquisition efficiencies by standardizing data, business rules, and milestone tracking.  Furthermore, CON-IT will allow for a standardized and integrated method of anticipating, reacting, and responding to the current pace and changes in process, regulation, and technology across the contract domain.  CON-IT will also address the immediate need of a Standard Procurement System (SPS) replacement as directed by Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) by 30 Sep 20 (OUSD/AT&amp;L Memo, 25 Sep 14). SPS has an initial brownout date of 30 Sep 18 with a sunset date of 30 Sep 20.  When fully implemented, CON-IT will enable process changes necessary to converge on a common contract writing/management capability within the Air Force.

CON-IT will address the current inefficiencies in the contracting domain, given there are multiple contract writing systems that continue to challenge the ability to operate responsively, consistently, and cost-effectively to award, administer, and close out mission critical contracts in a timely fashion. CON-IT will allow the contracting community to fully support compliance with financial auditability and Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) goals that depend on the integrity of the data flow through the Procure to Pay (P2P) process.

CON-IT activities also include studies and analyses to support ongoing and future program planning and execution associated with risk reduction, infrastructure, and other program activities.

This program is in Budget Activity 4, Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) because efforts are necessary to evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
