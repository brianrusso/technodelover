                    <r2:ProjectNote>Defense Forensic Material Exchange (DFME), is a new start in FY15.</r2:ProjectNote>
                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible, services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services as part of the Federal Data Center Consolidation effort, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.

The FY17 funding request was reduced by $1.328 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
