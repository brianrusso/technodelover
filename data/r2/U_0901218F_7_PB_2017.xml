                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The PE excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This Program Element (PE) is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
