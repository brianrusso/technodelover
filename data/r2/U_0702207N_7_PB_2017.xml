        <r2:ProgramElementNote>The MH-60 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is not a new start in FY 2017.  This work was commenced under PE 0604212N Other Helicopter Development, Project Unit 2415 H-60 Development.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Decrease in Depot Maintenance (NON-IF) by $0.466M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.  

3030: A significant portion of the F/A-18 airframe is believed to have additional inherent capability and a life extension may be possible for many portions of the airframe.  The F/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations inventory requirements.  Without SLAP and the follow on Service Life Extension Program, aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when a design service life metric is reached.   The FY17 budget request increased due to Resource Sponsor funding for increased depot capacity, Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) development, kit creation and installation to support service life extensions. RDTE funds will support aircraft teardown to validate SLAP analysis, identify unknown fatigue areas and assess the aircraft's material condition.  
 
3182: The T-45 SLAP is assessing the subsystem condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft subsystem design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Air Training Pilot and Naval Flight Officer training requirements through 2035.  

3384: The MH-60 SLAP is assessing the primary aircraft structure and subsystem condition of the MH-60S fleet in order to determine what efforts are necessary to extend the aircraft design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Operations operational inventory requirements through FY 2035.  Without SLAP, aircraft are retired from the USN inventory when design service life limits are reached directly impacting fleet surface warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and vertical replenishment operational capabilities.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F/A-18 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the structural and subsystem conditions of the F/A-18 fleet in order to determine what modifications are necessary to extend the aircraft designed life limits to allow it to achieve Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) inventory requirements. The goal of the F/A-18 SLAP program is to identify critical structures and components that can achieve the extended service life limit goals.  SLAP consists of structural analyses of the main landing gear, arresting hook and catapult back-up structures, vertical tails, wings and fuselage. A second effort is to assess the subsystem components (hydraulics, wiring, actuators, etc) to identify over and above inspections, overhaul intervals or replacement schedules to fly past design of 6,000 hours.  The current life limits for the F/A-18 E/F are 6,000 Flight Hours (FH), 2,250 catapults/arrestments (Cat/Traps) and 15,750 total landings. The F/A-18 SLAP program of record states the SLAP goals as 12,000 FH, 3,500 Cat/Traps and 22,500 total landings. The primary objective of F/A-18 SLAP is to determine if the stated SLAP goals are feasible. An increase in total landings and flight hours would allow the F/A-18 to meet CNO inventory requirements.  The requirements are integrated with the Joint Strike Fighter planned introduction.  This effort is required to be conducted for these airframes and subsystems to ascertain what actions and modifications must be taken to safely operate each system beyond its designed life until the targeted end of service life.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) program employs sole source contracts with Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer.  SLAP further decomposes program of record goals into smaller discrete steps, analyzing requirements to extend flight hours (FH) from 6,000 to 9,000 first.  These analyses will provide the raw engineering data to develop aircraft modifications to extend total aircraft landings, Cat/Traps, and FH.  The F/A-18 SLAP Program consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, assess current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet CNO objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete structural fatigue testing and actual fleet usage with the expectation of extending the service life of the F/A-18 aircraft.  Conducting F/A-18 SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and a follow on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                    <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The F/A-18 SLAP provides an assessment of aircraft structure fatigue life as affected by flight maneuver, Cat/Traps and landings, based on actual usage and identifies the efforts required to extend the aircraft life to SLAP goals.  During SLAP Structures Phase A (FY08-FY13) tools and modeling necessary to assess usage and fatigue life are developed.  During SLAP Structures Phase B (FY11-FY18) specific structural locations which do not meet SLAP goals are identified and analyzed.  Subsystem SLAP is also initiated concurrently with Structures Phase (B).  A Flight Control Surface SLAP, SLEP retrofit concepts and repairs for deficient locations are developed during SLAP Structures and Sub-Systems Phase C (FY14-FY21).  SLAP is followed by the SLEP during which the actual retrofit and repairs are performed under OSIP 020-14 established in FY14.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>3182: The T-45 aircraft structure is currently fatigue limited to 14,400 flight hours based on initial full-scale fatigue tests conducted from 1992-1996. This service life limit prevents the T-45 fleet from meeting Integrated Production Plan (IPP), previously Pilot Training Requirements, past 2025. Recent studies have determined that the fleet squadrons have not been flying the T-45 aircraft as aggressively as the initial fatigue studies predicted. These studies demonstrate that the 14,400 flight hour service life can likely be extended, with a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), to 21,600 flight hours, which will support meeting IPP until 2035. A T-45 Structural Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) was completed in February 2012.   The results are being used to provide guidance on what structural areas to SLEP. In order for the T-45 to meet IPP until 2035, it is also necessary to assess the sub-systems of the T-45 in their ability to remain viable.  Beginning in FY13, the T-45 sub-systems SLAP effort will assess the sub-system condition of the T-45 fleet in order to determine sub-system modifications and/or redesign necessary to extend the aircraft designed service life to support IPP and Naval Flight Officer Training Requirements (NTR) until 2035. This sub-system assessment will be based on the updated fleet aircraft usage spectrum and future predicted training missions of the T-45 aircraft. The assessment will address all critical sub-systems required and their ability to maintain IPP/NTR until 2035, analysis and studies will be conducted to outline improvements, assess manufacturing capabilities, prototype redesign and test of sub-systems for trainer aircraft. The original funding within the T-45 SLAP budget programmed for T-45 tail hook has been absorbed into the overarching SLAP effort due to the success of T-45 additional tail hook life extension efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Subsystem SLAP is a sole source contract effort with Boeing, the aircraft prime contractor.  SLAP consists of an analysis of the aircraft subsystems (e.g., Global Positioning System Inertial Navigation Assembly or Mission Data Processor).  The analysis will facilitate the future development of subsystem modifications and/or redesigns necessary to extend their life until 2035.

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MH-60 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) is assessing the primary aircraft structure and subsystem condition of the MH-60S fleet in order to determine what efforts are necessary to extend the aircraft design life limits to allow it to meet Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) operational inventory requirements through FY 2035.  The goal of the MH-60S SLAP program is to identify critical structures, components, and subsystems that can achieve the extended service life limit goals.  The current life limits for the MH-60S is 10,000 hours, however, a full scale fatigue test was never conducted and therefore, the MH-60S is in an on-condition state requiring additional structural inspections beginning at 6,500 hours.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                    <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) program employs sole source contracts with Sikorsky, the aircraft prime manufacturer, government engineering and logistics expertise at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River and the H-60 Fleet Support Team at Cherry Point, NC.  Analyses will provide the engineering data to develop aircraft structural, component, and subsystem modifications to extend service life flight hour limits.  The MH-60S SLAP consists of two major engineering efforts: the aircraft structural assessment and the aircraft subsystems assessment.  Both efforts are broken into multiple phases which develop tools and models, assess current aircraft usage, and develop concepts to extend aircraft life to meet Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) objectives.  The program will combine exploitation of complete aircraft teardown inspections and actual historical fleet usage.  Conducting MH-60S SLAP to study the aircraft lifetime will provide a better estimate of aircraft service life and is required to determine scope of the follow-on Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                    <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The MH-60 SLAP Fatigue Life Analysis (FLA) provides an assessment of aircraft structure fatigue life as affected by flight maneuver and Ground-Air-Ground cycles, based on Government furnished usage spectra and identifies the efforts required to extend the aircraft life to SLAP goals.  During the FLA External Loads Analysis (FY 2017), external loads for all fatigue conditions are identified from the three usage spectra. During the FLA Fatigue Analysis (FY 2017-FY 2020), the fatigue analysis results and calculated fatigue lives are documented and areas for future improvements to extend the A/C service life are identified. During the FLA Structural Analysis (FY 2019-FY 2021), static fail-safety analyses of specific airframe sites are conducted to substantiate continued safe flight and identify areas for future service life extensions. Subsystem SLAP Phase B is initiated concurrently with the FLA. During Subsystems SLAP Phase B (FY 2017-FY 2019), analytical service life risk assessments of aircraft subsystems are conducted and initial dispositions for safety-critical items are developed. During Subsystems SLAP Phase C (FY 2019-FY 2020), dispositions of Phase B are executed by performing component tests, aircraft inspections, and assembly teardowns and SLEP dispositions are developed for safety critical components based on new data.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
