Mobile user access to JSIN services includes unclassified and classified mobile device use of JSIN-U and JSIN-S portals.  Subscription to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provided Unified Capabilities portfolio will allow a full complement of voice, video, chat, web conferencing, email, and mobility functionality.  Continued refinement of the U.S. Army Information Technology Agency desktop as a service,  Application Virtualization (S) and (U), Cross Domain Services, Enterprise Content Management  and Task Management (U) optimization and integration, Enterprise Services Implementation including Enterprise Task Management (U/S), Identity and Access Management capabilities, completion of a Managed Print Service (MPS) and consideration of DoD cloud services will achieve efficiencies, improve mission effectiveness, and strengthen our security posture.</r2:Text>

                    <r2:PerformanceMetrics>(1) Reduce technical support hours per desktop a minimum of 10% through deployment of thin client and virtualized management of the IT baseline.

(2) Avoid cost for technology refresh of NIPR and SIPR desktops via the proper planning, testing, and piloting of a Joint Staff Thin Client solution.

(3) Reduce the cost of building, operating, and maintaining Joint Staff specific solutions through implementation of enterprise capabilities, and adoption of new cost models for execution (Enterprise Task management, Unified Communications, JIE, and Managed Print Services (MPS).

(4) Reduce redundancies in Core and Mission IT Capabilities through implementation of a comprehensive portfolio management policy and avoid cost through the institutionalization of investment management governance model.

(5) Reduce cost of Joint Staff controlled IT-services by subscribing to locally hosted IT services providers (Joint IT Service Provider-Pentagon (JITSP-P).</r2:PerformanceMetrics>
