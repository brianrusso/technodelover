        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PATRIOT is an advanced Surface-to-Air guided missile system with a high probability of kill, capable of operation in the presence of Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and able to conduct multiple simultaneous engagements against high performance air breathing targets and ballistic missiles likely to be encountered by U.S. Forces.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program provides for the upgrade of the PATRIOT System through individual materiel changes and upgrades to the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability with the emerging threat.  Efforts will be made to expedite PATRIOT materiel solutions (e.g. Radar Digital Processor, Communications Upgrades, address Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM) capability, Combat ID, and Advanced ECM improvements) to both enhance capability and facilitate integration into the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.  

The software funding provides improvements to the PATRIOT system against the evolving threat. This effort supports work with national agencies to evaluate, assess, and develop means to mitigate threat trends and specific threat developments potentially impacting system performance.  Specific improvements may be developed and fielded under this task if warranted. The effort maintains the Mission Tailoring Database, responding to immediate tactical concerns.  Database updates are fielded between major software upgrades as necessary.

FY2017 base dollars will add assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) activities and continue Software Improvement for Threat Evolution, Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM), Tasks 2, 6, and 7 activities, and Combat ID Enhancements for the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software Improvements for threat evolution:  Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM):  Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment.  Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Development:  Incorporates improvements to mitigate radar hardware obsolescence, improves Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) and improves performance of the PATRIOT Radar Set against evolving threat sets.  This program includes the implementation of Identification Friend or Foe Mode 5 Level 1 / Level 2, and a Non-Cooperative Target Recognition Combat ID technique to mitigate potential fratricide risk, and the development of CONOPS to incorporate the new Combat ID capabilities into system operation.  The RDP also provides the necessary radar processing capability to support follow-on Evolutionary Development Program (EDP) Tasks 6 and 7 to counter emerging threats and provide data necessary to support migration to IAMD.  The RDP is a pre-requisite for migration to an IAMD Netted Sensor.

RDP Waveform Suite:  Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system improvements.  The RDP implementation allows significant radar waveform improvements necessary to counter evolving threats.

SIPRNet/NIPRNet Access Point/Troposcatter (SNAP/TROPO):  Provides hardware interfaces to support extended range communications within the battalion (TROPO) and Force Operations interfaces to satellite for access to SIPR/NIPR worldwide communication networks. 
 
THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability:  Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations.  Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability. 
 
Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement  missiles.

Task 7:  Software improvements analyze existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures and their effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops concepts to address countermeasure effects and ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military’s improved Global Position M-Code with Patriot Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C)/ Flat Panel Array Concept Study:  This task provides studies for initial concepts and performance capabilities related to the implementation of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) transmitter/antenna into the PATRIOT radar.  These assessments are needed to refine user community expectations and requirements, and to prepare a viable set of requirements to support a competitive modernization competition.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense:  Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks.  Builds on an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Lower Tier Air &amp; Missile Defense-Capability (LTAMD-C):  LTAMD-C tasks include all the programmatic and engineering activities needed for the LTAMD-C Materiel Development Decision, Analysis of Alternatives, and Business Case Analyses/Trades. Once the material solution has been determined, the development effort for LTAMD-C will be accomplished.  These activities will continue through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction and Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase to enable the prototyping, development, and testing of the LTAMD-C continued under 0604114A in FY17.
