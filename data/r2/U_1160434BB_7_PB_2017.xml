        <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017 Unmanned ISR represents the approved consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies Program Element (PE) 0304210BB; MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), PE 0305219BB; MQ-8 PE 0305231BB; RQ-11 UAV PE 1105232BB; and RQ-7 UAV, PE 1105233BB.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harmâ€™s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the related ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  

Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC). Provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.

Group 1 UAS.  Group 1 UAS are small tactical systems, less than 20 pounds in weight.  Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits.  The FY 2017 funding was reduced by $0.142 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Group 2 UAS.  Group 2 UAS are medium tactical systems, between 21 pounds and 55 pounds in weight. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.

Group 3 UAS.  Group 3 UAS are large tactical systems that weigh less than 1,320 pounds and fly less than flight level 180.    

Group 4 UAS.  Group 4 UAS are large systems that weigh greater than 1,320 pounds and fly higher than flight level 180. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
