                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding request was reduced by $.269M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding supports Personnel Recovery development efforts to upgrade Isolated Personnel reporting devices &amp; locating systems in support of Combatant Commanders and Services. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) developmental efforts address Personnel Recovery capability shortfalls &amp; gaps identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012. Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.

In FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture &amp; Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
