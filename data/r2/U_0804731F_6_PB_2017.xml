                    <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>TECHNICAL TRAINING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TTMS): TTMS provides AETC organizations with a world class commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) / government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) learning management system which supports six functions: course design and development; student evaluation; instructor management; student management; data analysis; and resource administration. TTMS is a centralized web-based system which provides productivity enhancements and higher degree of efficiency to AETC. The primary requirement objectives currently under development are: 1) Integration of Basic Training Management System (BTMS) capabilities and student records into the TTMS.

This program is in Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because this budget activity includes research, development, test and evaluation efforts and funds to sustain and/or modernize the installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>
